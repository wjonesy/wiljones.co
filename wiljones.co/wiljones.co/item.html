                <p>Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? I'll get my kit!</p>
                <p>I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Take me to your leader! <strong> The alien mothership is in orbit here.</strong> <em> If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards.</em> Checkmate.</p>
                <h2>You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!</h2>
                <p>Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Hey, whatcha watching? Oh right. I forgot about the battle. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>We're rescuing ya.</li>
                    <li>Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.</li>
                    <li>One hundred dollars.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Now what?</h3>
                <p>I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</li>
                    <li>THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</li>
                    <li>I'm Santa Claus!</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.</p>
                <p>Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? No. We're on the top.</p>
                <p>Throw her in the brig. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. Leela's gonna kill me. Moving along…</p>
                <p>Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. You can see how I lived before I met you. You are the last hope of the universe. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!</p>
                <p>You mean while I'm sleeping in it? They're like sex, except I'm having them! Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.</p>
                <p>I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! She also liked to shut up!</p>
                <p>Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?</p>
                <p>I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! OK, if everyone's finished being stupid.</p>
                <p>I'll get my kit! Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!</p>
                <p>Say what? They're like sex, except I'm having them! I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. Moving along…</p>
                <p>Throw her in the brig. Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! I'm Santa Claus! Really?! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!</p>
